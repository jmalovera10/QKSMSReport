                                            MainActivity.
                                            We found that it has strong relationships with UI components, which doubles

                                            consumption when the app is under rotation stress. From the heap dumps it
                                            can be seen that
                                            Java objects are created and maintained in memory after several rotation
                                            events. For example,
                                            the messagesâ€™ RecycleView object is created and maintained over and over
                                            again, which means
                                            that this UI component has a strong reference to the MainActivity, which is
                                            a bad memory
                                            management practice. As it can be seen from the heap dump, there are as many

                                        <p>When using the Android lint tool to search for unused imports, we found that
                                            there
                                            were not any declared import that was not used, which means that it is
                                            already optimized
                                            in that aspect. Nevertheless, when looking at the lint report there are
                                            several other issues
                                            that are not necessarily related to performance. We advise checking the

                                However, we did find a lot of iterators which is a performance bad practice in methods that are repeatedly called. We also found one case of objects declared inside a loop which consumes unnecessary memory.
                                Finally we found that some portions of the code used findItem which is known to be a resource eager method and it was not possible changing it without greatly changing the code.   "

                                Avoid using findById as it is energy greedy, at this point the code is made so that this usage is mandatory but repetitive it could be useful to change it.
