                                        <p>We first made memory profiling on the application, starting with the
                                            MainActivity.
                                            We found that it has strong relationships with UI components, which doubles
                                            the memory
                                            consumption when the app is under rotation stress. From the heap dumps it
                                            can be seen that
                                            Java objects are created and maintained in memory after several rotation
                                            events. For example,
                                            the messagesâ€™ RecycleView object is created and maintained over and over
                                            again, which means
                                            that this UI component has a strong reference to the MainActivity, which is
                                            a bad memory
                                            management practice. As it can be seen from the heap dump, there are as many

                                            instances as rotations made.
