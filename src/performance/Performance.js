                                 consumption when the app is under rotation stress. From the heap dumps it can be seen that
                                 Java objects are created and maintained in memory after several rotation events. For example,
                                 the messagesâ€™ RecycleView object is created and maintained over and over again, which means
                                 that this UI component has a strong reference to the MainActivity, which is a bad memory
