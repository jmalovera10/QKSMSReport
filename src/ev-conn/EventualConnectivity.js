                                When there is no network access sms fail in the sending process generating a notification that is shown to the user and prompts him to retry.
                                When messages are scheduled and there is no network when the message is supposed to be sent, the same notification is launched.
                                The app does not alert the user that any of these fails are because of a network error.
                                As it is done when trying to make a call, that the app realises that airplane mode is on and prompts to turn it off.
                                Furthermore, eventual connectivity is not being handled for mms files.
                                Sending messages is done through a RX subscription,
                                it seems like a new stream is launch when a message needs to be sent and it keeps running until it is sent, with no possibility of being deleted or handling errors.

                                 Maybe you could even check for airplane mode when trying to send a message and prompt the user to disable it.
                                 Use queues for scheduling messages that were not sent.
